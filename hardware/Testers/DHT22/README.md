# DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

This sensor reads both temperature and humidity at the same time. I have utilised the Adafruit DHT22 library as it is stable and mature, and easily installed. 

## Use

Upload this sketch, and connect via the hardware serial UART. The device will send the current readings for temperature and humidity in a human readable format, with a 2 second delay between readings.
