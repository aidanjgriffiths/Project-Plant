# Testers

These Arduino sketches were designed with a few functions in mind. Firstly, they were used to allow the easy testing of individual components and learning how to use them and their libraries. Secondly, they allowed the hardware to be validated at various stages by having a known configuration that would be carried through various revisions, and by uploading these sketches invidivudally the various incarnations of the hardware could be compared and validated for accidental changes. Thirdly, as the device became more complicated, changes to the hardware and individual components could be easily and independently tested for proper function while avoiding the complexity of the main firmware. All of these features can be retained for future iterations as well, allowing easy and rapid improvement and validation cycles to be undertaken.
